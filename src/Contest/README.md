## Biweekly contest 150. 
[Date]. February 15. 2025
I just wanted to explore how contests worked, I need to practice more but I wanted to give it a go anyway. I entered with 50m left in the contest.
1. [Easy] sumOfGoodNumbers. I completed this on first try
2. [Medium] SeparateSquares I. I was trying to it with DaC approach but i ran out of time :c
